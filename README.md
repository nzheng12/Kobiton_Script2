# Kobiton_Script2

I used powershell for this following challenge for the same reason as challenge 1. I am not the best with powershell but it is what I am most familiar with. I first have to grab log file within the log folder by using the get-childitem, once that have been achieved I proceed to utilize the forEach-object to grab the content within each log file. After I grabbed the content, I looped through every line within the content and then used Regex to find the date/time pattern of that stack trace. After finding the date then I proceed to the next line to see if I have a matching string and if the string matches then I'll check if that string is the first occurrence.. Once that string returns as the first occurrences then I set that date as the variable for first occurrence.  To get the latest occurrence I basically made a comparison on every date I found. The one with the greatest value will be the latest occurrence.  For the first occurrence and latest occurrence, I assigned them as a global variable. I added the count++ outside of the second loop so it will count for the amount of times the string was found. Lastly I proceed on printing out the result in a text file. I inserted the clear-item at the top of the script so the text file wonâ€™t have duplicate text appended to the text file if the script was ran multiple times.
